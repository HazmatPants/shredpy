 # shredpy â€” A Simple Yet Effective File Shredder

`shredpy` is a Python-based command-line tool that securely shreds files by overwriting them with multiple patterns and deleting them. Lightweight, no dependencies required.
## Features
- Overwrite files with customizable number of passes
- Supports patterns: `0x00`, `0xFF`, and random data (`os.urandom`)
- Verbose output for nerdy satisfaction
- Dry-run mode for safety checks
- Cross-platform compatible (Windows/Linux/macOS)
